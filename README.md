Your Flutter application sets up a basic navigation system with three screens: Sign In, Sign Up, and Calculator. It allows navigation between these screens using both a `BottomNavigationBar` and a `Drawer`. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of your code:

1. **Main Function**: 
    - This is the entry point of the Flutter application. The `runApp` function takes the `MyApp` widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.

2. **MyApp Class**:
    - A stateless widget that builds the `MaterialApp`. 
    - It sets the app title, theme, and the initial screen (`HomeScreen`).

3. **HomeScreen Class**:
    - A stateful widget that manages the state of the selected screen using the `_selectedIndex` variable.
    - It maintains a list of screens (`_screens`), which includes instances of `SignInScreen`, `SignUpScreen`, and `CalculatorScreen`.
    - It defines the `_onItemTapped` function to update `_selectedIndex` when a navigation item is tapped.

4. **_HomeScreenState Class**:
    - Builds the `Scaffold` widget, which provides the structure for the screen.
    - The `AppBar` displays the title.
    - The `body` of the scaffold displays the current screen based on `_selectedIndex`.
    - The `BottomNavigationBar` allows navigation between the screens. The `onTap` callback calls `_onItemTapped` to update `_selectedIndex`.
    - The `Drawer` provides another way to navigate between the screens. It contains `ListTile` widgets for each screen. When a list tile is tapped, the drawer closes and the `_onItemTapped` function is called to update `_selectedIndex`.

### Key Components

1. **BottomNavigationBar**:
    - It contains three items, each with an icon and a label.
    - `currentIndex` is bound to `_selectedIndex`, so the selected item is highlighted.
    - `onTap` is set to `_onItemTapped`, updating the screen based on the tapped item.

2. **Drawer**:
    - Contains a `DrawerHeader` and three `ListTile` widgets.
    - Each `ListTile` has an `onTap` callback to update the selected screen and close the drawer.

### Summary

- The app has three screens: Sign In, Sign Up, and Calculator.
- Navigation is handled using a `BottomNavigationBar` and a `Drawer`.
- Tapping an item in the `BottomNavigationBar` or `Drawer` updates the `_selectedIndex`, which changes the displayed screen.
